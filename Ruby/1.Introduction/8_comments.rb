# COMMENTS

# SINGLE AND MULTI LINE COMMENTS
# Comments are programmer-readable annotations that are ignored at runtime. Their purpose is to make source
# code easier to understand.

# 1: Single line comments
# The "#" character is used to add single line comments.

# This is a single line comment.
puts "Hello World!"

# 
# 2: Multiline comments
# Multiple-line comments can be added by using =begin and =end syntax (also known as the comment block markers)
# as follows:

=begin
This is a multiline comment.
Write as many line as you want.
=end
puts "Hello World!"

# When executed, the above program will output Hello World!
